# Tea-Quality-Analyser
This is used to automatically detect and take a count of the differnt types of tea leaf from a set of tea leaves spreadout, and thus analyse the quality of the harvest by the random samplinh of the tea leaves from the lot.
I used OpenCV for the EdgeDetection to extract each of the leaves from the lot, and used TensorFlow to classify the detected leaves as small leaf, big leaf, or two leaf and a bud.
